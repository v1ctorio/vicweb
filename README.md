# Vic-web

This is my personal website, written using Astro and a backend made in rust.

For this project I have three repos, this one, vicwebsync and vicwebimport (little script).

This one, the main one consists of a Astro project with templates that manages my articles and the main website.
My website uses a simple style only using text and chill colors, I like it the way it is and it was kind of a challenge to make for me since I'm very bad with css or styling or designing.

But if there is something Im worst its rust, this project also uses a rust backend which took me an akward time to make and retrives messages from my telegram channel and discord channel to put them on my website, on the Posts tab.

I hope you like it :)))
